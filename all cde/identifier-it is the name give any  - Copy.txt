identifier-it is the name give any component of program.
variable,array,function,classes,structures,union,namespace etc.
rules for identifier
1)no space chartcter other than _(underscorce)is used an identifier.
2)the first charcter of an identifier must be any alphabet or _(underscorce).
3)we can used alphabet digit as well as underscorce charter for setting the name of any component as an identifier.
4)no space are used in b/w the identifier name .
5)the length of the identifier dependend on the architecture of the compiler.
6)no reserve word or keyword as a an identifier.
7)c++ is case-sensitve so small case and capital case latter used for identifier.it is treat as different as for compiler.
variable:-it is an identifier which changeable during execution of program.
int a;
value used for variable may varies during exection of program.
array:-container of similer types of data elements.
int a[n]={n}//row indicate.
int a[],b[]=
function:-it is a self contain program desigin to avoid multiple or duplicate instruction in the program.
function for adding two number.
class:-it is grouping of similar type of object.
class a
int a,b;
public;
a{}
{
cout<<"enter two no";
cin>>a>>b;
}
~a()
{
cout<<"the sum of"<<num1<<and<<num2;
int main()
{
a p;
return 0;
//obj.show();
structure:-it is used to mangae the record containing different type of attritubtes of fields.
syntax
struct student;
{
int name[20];
int id[18];
};
memory sharing concenpt is included  through union
namesace:-it is used to set the spefic prodecure withn the program as per required.
constant:-the value used for constant never changed during execution of program.
example:-numeriac int,float,charcter,string
//satic intizalition

 entire opertion operter in c++->on the bais of opertors 
in c++,there are three types opertor frmat used that is as follows
1)unary opertor=>the operator which is used along with single operand is known as unary opertor
ex->-,++,--,+etc.
2)binary opertor=>the opertor which is used along with two operand is known as binary opertor.
ex->+,-,*,/,etc.
3)TRINARY->the opertor which is used along with three operand is knowns as trinary opertor
in C++ conditional opertor is used as a trinary operator.
condition which is ->?
if(a>=10)
cout<<a;
else
cout<<a*a;
(a>=10)?cout<<a:cout<<a*a;
the varoius opertor in c++as follow 
1)arthmetic opertor
2)relational opertor
3)logical opertor
4)conditional opertor
5)assignment opertor
6)bitwise opertor
7)sizeof opertor
8)comma opertor,
punchuter opertor
9)opening and closing opertor
